# FavouritePage (JavaScript assigment at Noroff)

with loginform to add, update and delete products from Strapi API 

Strapi API is not publicly hosted (https://github.com/NoroffFEU/strapi-js2-ca) 

# Description
- GET request to fetch a list of resources from your API. 
- Create HTML for each item and display at least 3 properties for each. 
- Each item should also display a button or icon. Clicking on this button should toggle the item in and out of an array stored in localStorage.
- There should be a text input on this page that filters the array of results on one of the properties.
- Favourites page: This page should fetch the array of items stored in localStorage and display them or display a message that there are no items. There should be a “Clear all” button that clears localStorage (or just a specific key in localStorage) and reloads the display. Don’t reload the page, just redraw the HTML.
 - Login form that will allow a logged in admin user to perform the following tasks: Adding new resources to the API, Updating resources through an edit form, Deleting resources
